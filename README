4-day forecast and 5-day forecast
------------------------

Update: I have analyzed the 5-day forecast application and it uses the same getweather.php
script. Thus the same set of scripts should work.

This works with Weather station of this kind:
http://www.evolveo.eu/cz/pilot

This weather station uses windows "4-day forecast" application and external usb
transmitter.

Since the original asian server deciced to stop working for few days I have
written my own implementation of the server.

Original service was using "FORECA" as data source. This is highly commercial
source of weather data. I deciced to implement it on top of openweathermap.org.

It should be easy to change to any other service if you wish.

Some things are not working yet, as the data is not contained in the forecast
feed and it would be necessary to get data from different feed:
	- sunrise/sunset times
	- uv index
	- probability of percipitation

Things that probably need improvement are weather codes. I tried my best to
match the OWM codes to codes of the application.

Mapping of city codes is magic - foreca and OWM use almost the same city codes.
And i have tested it for few cities and it works. (just substract 10000000 from
foreca city code to get OWM city code)

Also this script implements data caching for at least 4 hours. 4-dat forecast
application requests update every 4hours or so.


If you find some problem tell me, pathches are welcome!


Installation
------------------
On windows:
Install apache server with php support. I used WAMP.
(http://www.wampserver.com/en/). Place all php files into c:\wamp\www.
Register on openweathermap, and retrieve api key. Place the api key into
getweather.php script - in the api_key variable:

$api_key = 'your key goes here';

Edit (as administrator):
%systemroot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file.
(on standard system C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts)
and add line

127.0.0.1 server1.netinfostation.com

save and exit.

This will redirect all traffic to the original server to your local
computer.

Restart the "4-dat forecast" application and it should be done :-).
